  <md:title>Compassion: Well-Being, Capabilities, and Appropriate Technology</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This module unpacks compassion through its constitutive appraisals of size, nondesert, and circle of concern. Cultivating moral emotions such as compassion is accomplished by identifying and removing bias from the emotion’s appraisals and the underlying theories that support these appraisals.  Compassion can play a key role in reengaging STEM students with issues of social, ethical, and global import. According to Erin Cech, meritocracy is an ideology adopted by STEM students in their undergraduate education that prevents them from empathically engaging with those suffering from sizable, undeserved misfortune.  Cultivating compassion counteracts this disengagement.  Studying compassion’s underlying theories also promotes reengagement.  These underlying theories include a theory of the value of external objects, a theory of moral responsibility, and a theory of the importance of others to one’s own well-being.  In this module, you will study compassion by exploring its constitutive appraisals and by examining the supporting theories of well-being, justice, responsibility, and autonomy. This module has been developed through the National Science Foundation grant, Cultivating Responsible Wellbeing in STEM: Social Engagement Through Personal Ethics. (NSF SES 1449486).</md:abstract>

  <section id="eip-402"><title>Introduction</title><list id="eip-395"><title>The Good Woman of Setzuan</title><item>In Bertholt Brecht’s, The Good Woman of Setzuan, the gods give Shen Teh money to start a new business; they give this gift in recognition of her goodness and compassion. But the very qualities that the gods have praised have also undermined her ability to operate that business successfully. Unscrupulous suppliers overcharged her, dishonest customers took merchandise without paying, freeloading families moved into the backroom without paying rent, and her landlord demanded unreasonably high rent. Shen Teh’s goodness and compassion, it seems, have rendered her incompetent in business.</item>

<item>Read Brecht's play and discover the secret behind its two key characters, Shen Teh, characterized by goodness and compassion, and her cousin, Shui Ta, the epitome of the ruthless business practitioner. Brecht’s central problem is the compatibility of business and compassion. Is Shen Teh doomed to fail as an entrepreneur because she is too good and compassionate? Does "doing business" transform one into an entrepreneur like Shui Ta who sets compassion aside while maximizing profits and self-interest?</item>

<item>Emotions according to Martha Nussbaum “imply intentional thought or perception directed at an object (as perceived or imagined by the person who has the emotion) and some type of evaluative appraisal of that object made from the agent’s own personal viewpoint.” (Nussbaum, Anger, Appendix A, loc 5440). To understand compassion as an emotion, we must (1) identify its object, (2) describe its three appraisals (size, nondesert, and eudaimonism) and (3) situate the emotion within the corresponding virtue of compassion which steers the emotion along the right path by deploying supporting perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, understandings, habits, and dispositions.  The virtue of compassion directs the emotion toward the mean between the extremes of too much and too little, between excess feeling that results in compassion burnout and defective feeling that causes indifference and apathy.</item>
  
</list><para id="eip-192">This is one of a series of modules that looks at key moral emotions and how they enter into the world of business.  Compassion will be examined in terms of its object, constitutive judgments or appraisals, surrounding virtues, and supporting theories.  In particular, compassion rests on theories of responsibility and well-being.</para></section><section id="eip-725"><title>What you need to know: Compassion as an Emotion and as a Virtue</title><para id="eip-486"><title>Compassion appraises the impact of the undeserved, sizable suffering of others on one’s well-being.</title>Aristotle defines compassion as <emphasis>“a feeling of pain caused by the sight of some evil, destructive or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, and which we might expect to befall ourselves or some friend of ours, and moreover to befall us soon”</emphasis> (Rhetoric, 1385b13 ff.). Nussbaum’s definition is more concise: <emphasis>“Compassion…is a painful emotion directed at another person’s misfortune or suffering”</emphasis> (UT 305). The difference between these two definitions is that Nussbaum treats “similar possibilities,” not as a constituent of compassion, but as a motive for it.  Similar possibilities is the idea that I could suffer from what others are suffering because I share with them certain key vulnerabilities.  Similar possibilities is expressed in the common sentiment, “there but for the grace of God go I.”  Nussbaum’s broader account of compassion allows one to empathize with others even when one does not share in their vulnerabilities.
</para><para id="eip-287"><title>Compassion's Object: the sizable, underserved, suffering of significant others</title>Compassion’s external object, then, is the undeserved, sizable suffering of others. The characteristic external object of an emotion serves to differentiate it from other emotions; these objects can be characterized in terms of their <emphasis>temporality, valence, and modality</emphasis>.  Compassion’s object is in the present (the suffering of others is occurring now), negative in its valence (this suffering diminishes the well-being of the sufferer), and actual (as opposed to possible or necessary).  The object of compassion (the undeserved suffering of others) is appraised in terms of its impact on the well-being of the person experiencing the emotion.  Because others enter into an individual’s scheme of goals and projects—his or her very identity—they form a part of that individual’s “circle of concern.”  </para><para id="eip-334"><title>Compassion relies on three judgments or appraisals:</title>Here is a description of each of compassion’s constitutive appraisals: size, nondesert, and eudaimonia (Nussbaum, UT and Aristotle, Rhetoric):</para><list id="eip-942"><title>Appraisal One: Size</title><item>“First, there is a thought of seriousness: in experiencing compassion, the person who feels the emotion thinks that someone else is suffering in some way that is important and nontrivial.” (Political Emotions 142). Drawing the line between serious and trivial misfortunes is difficult. Clearly, death and catastrophic illness are serious or sizable. But what about suffering from a traffic jam, a boring lecture, or being struck with an obsolete smart phone? These misfortunes are not sizable by nature but can they become so by convention?</item>
  
<item>Aristotle grounds his list of sizable misfortunes in his view of human nature.  For Aristotle, humans are social animals.  Each of these misfortunes attacks the animal nature of humans (illness attacks the body) while lack of friends undermines the need of an individual to construct social relations with others.  Here is Aristotle’s list of sizable misfortunes:</item>
 
<item><emphasis>“Death, bodily assault, or ill treatment, old age, illness, lack of food, lack of friends, separation from friends, physical weakness, disfigurement, immobility, reversals of expectations, absence of good prospects”</emphasis> (Nussbaum, Upheavals of Thought, 86 and Aristotle’s Rhetoric, A6-13)</item>

<item>These misfortunes negate potentialities that constitute central human capabilities; fulfilling these capabilities is necessary for well-being.  Capabilities, as will be seen below, are “beings and doings” that characterize a full life of human dignity.  In the “good life,” individuals are free to realize these capabilities in whatever way they choose.  Misfortune arises when the expression or realization of key capabilities is blocked through an individual’s handicap or because the environment withholds necessary and useful affordances.</item>

<item>Candice Clark in Misery and Company provides a list of things that are misfortunes through convention:</item> 

<item><emphasis>“poverty, a partner’s infidelity, death of a loved ones,…illness (including “functional” or behavioral illnesses such as alcoholism and drug use), physical or mental disabilities or deformities, injury and pain, war trauma, sexual abuse, physical abuse, crime victimization, disaster victimization, (e.g., by earthquakes, hurricanes, airplane crashes), homelessness, infertility, divorce (or loss of partner), discrimination (e.g., in jobs or housing), political victimization (e.g., liberties abridged by tyrannical government), role strain (e.g., single parenthood), unwanted pregnancy, physical unattractiveness, car accidents, car trouble, house trouble (e.g., leaky roof), insensitive parents, ungrateful children, social ostracism, loss in competition (e.g., sports or job), depression, fear, public humiliation, accidental embarrassment, fatigue, bad judgment, ruined vacations, boredom and discomfort (e.g., enduring heat, cold, and traffic jams)”</emphasis> (UT 307).</item>
  
<item>Clark’s list moves from misfortunes that are unquestionably sizable to those problematically so.  For example, are traffic jams really indicative of sizable misfortunes?  Perhaps chronic traffic jams are serious because they make it more difficult to move about in one’s socio-technical surroundings (undermining the capability of bodily integrity), and they may have long term negative health effects (undermining the capability of bodily health).</item>  

<item>What constitutes a sizable misfortune depends on context, for example, on whether an individual’s socio-technical environment offers or withholds affordances crucial to the realization of human potentialities or capabilities.  The importance of context makes it difficult to separate what is a misfortune by convention from what is a misfortune by nature.</item>

</list><list id="eip-470"><title>Appraisal Two: Nondesert or nonfault appraisal</title><item>“Second, is the thought of nonfault: we typically don’t feel compassion if we think the person’s predicament chosen or self-inflicted” (Political Emotions 142).  According to this appraisal, compassion draws upon a common, shared conception of moral responsibility. F. H. Bradley understands responsibility through the metaphor of an individual being called upon to answer for his or her past actions. Imagine appearing before a moral court and defending your actions before this court and its judge.  If the action is bad, you offer an excuse designed to get you off the hook, that is, to avoid or deflect blame.</item>  

<item> An agent is capable of answering for what he or she has done when: (1)The agent maintains personal identity over time (selfsameness); (2)The agent is able to appreciate the moral quality of his or her actions (moral sense or moral perception); (3)The agent's actions arise from choices made voluntarily and knowingly.  As Bradley puts it, the source of the action is in the will of the agent (ownership).  Excusing one’s conduct by pleading ignorance or compulsion is a way of disowning one’s actions.</item>

<item>Bradley calls these “conditions of imputability” because they allow us to associate an action with an agent for purposes of moral evaluation, i.e., assigning praise or blame. Denying a condition of imputability creates an excuse.  We deny selfsameness by the excuse, “You’ve got the wrong person—I didn’t do it.”  The excuses, “I didn’t know what I was doing” or “I was forced to do it” deny ownership.  Finally, we excuse children from being held responsible because they have not yet reached the point where they can perceive and appreciate the moral qualities associated with their actions.  Bradley’s framework allows us to determine whether individuals suffer because they have been overwhelmed by circumstances or because they have brought about their suffering through their own intentional actions.</item>     
</list><para id="eip-44"><title>Appraisal Three: Eudaimonistic Judgment</title>Eudaimonistic Appraisal: “the eudaimonistic judgment [holds] that others (even distant others) are an important part of one’s own scheme of goals and projects, important as ends in their own right.” (UT 320).  From the standpoint of “possessive individualism” (a view of the self as complete apart from others) this appraisal makes no sense; how can someone else's well-being fall under my “circle of concern.” But if we take the view that our relations with others enter essentially into our identities and central projects, then it follows that their well-being is a subset of our individual well-being.  This eudaimonistic judgment then presupposes a view of human nature that designates humans as essentially social (Grotius) or as social (or political) animals (Aristotle).  This eudaimonistic judgment is key to experiencing compassion and directing this emotion to the right persons, on the right occasions, and to the right degree.  It first requires viewing the human, not as an isolated atom cut off from others, but as essentially social.  Second, as Aristotle points out, the perception of “similar possibilities” can serve as a motive for feeling compassion.  I become interested in others who suffer because I share with them the same vulnerabilities; only a change in fortune or luck separates me from them.  Third, compassion occurs when the suffering of others becomes concrete for me.  Emotions bring concrete particulars to an individual’s attention; they help us to attend to what is immediate as opposed to what is distant and remote.</para><para id="eip-980"><title>A Sidebar on Human Nature</title><emphasis>Possessive individualism</emphasis> holds that: <emphasis>“cada persona es dueña de sus facultades y del producto de sus facultades sin deber por ello nada a la sociedad”</emphasis> (Adela Cortina 299 summarizing C. B. MacPearson’s Possessive Individualism). Each person is the owner of her faculties and the product of these faculties without owing anything for this to society. The eudaimonistic appraisal, again, goes against <emphasis>possessive individualism</emphasis>. It views the human individual as irreducibly social from birth. As was said just above, Aristotle conceives of the human being as a <emphasis>social animal</emphasis>.  But he also characterizes the human as a <emphasis>rational animal</emphasis>: (1) by the term “rational,” he emphasizes the centrality of practical reasoning for human beings, the fact that human individuals have goals and aspirations, make plans that specify means and resources needed to reach these goals and aspirations, and then act skillfully and in complex ways to realize their goals and aspirations; (2) by the term “animal,” Aristotle draws attention to the fact that humans have bodies, perceive and move about, are vulnerable, and are constrained by their mortality.  On Aristotle’s view, our relations to others enter into our personal identities; we find our identities through the friendships we have forged, the groups to which we belong, and the alliances we build with others.  This social conception of human nature makes the eudaimonistic judgment both intelligible and necessary. I am concerned for others because their well-being overlaps with my own, and because their cooperation is necessary if I am to achieve my own well-being. (See Coeckelbergh cited below for more on human nature and the capability approach.)</para><list id="eip-96"><title>A Non-Aristotelian Account of Compassion</title><item>Judith Andre in Worldly Virtue turns to Buddhism to outline a somewhat different conception of compassion, both as an emotion and as a virtue. Instead of being a pain, compassion, in the Buddhist tradition, is more of a "flickering." This implies that compassion is appropriate even when an individual suffers from a misfortune that is less than sizable. In fact, under Buddhism all suffering is caused by becoming too attached to external objects over which we have no control. We feel compassion for others because they have fallen prey to a condition that besets all humans. When applied to health care, proper compassion balances concern and empathy with detachment and impartiality.  Compassion enables the health care provider to feel with the patient, to share in his or her suffering, but not to the point where this feeling with interferes with the skillful exercise of professional judgment.</item>
 
<item>This Buddhist conception of compassion also weakens the appraisals of size, nondesert, and eudaimonia.  It may be appropriate to feel compassion for sufferings that are less than sizable, for sufferings that individuals have—at least partially—brought upon themselves, and for individuals suffering from vulnerabilities not shared by others.  As a result, Andre provides a more concise definition of compassion: “compassion as an emotion is a response to the suffering of a particular sentient being together with a desire to help.” (Andre, Worldly Virtue, 68 and 75).</item>
  
</list><list id="eip-258"><title>Compassion as a Virtue</title><item>Compassion (the emotion) draws upon the skills and capacities embodied in the corresponding virtue so that one direct this emotion to the right objects, to the right degree, and on the right occasions.  As with many other emotions, one must integrate compassion into its corresponding virtue to ensure that it functions properly.  Virtues guide emotions by means of cultivated perceptions, understandings, attitudes, beliefs, dispositions, and habits.  When functioning properly, these steer the emotion adroitly between the pitfalls of too much and too little.  Too much compassion derails professional judgment and causes burnout.  Too little blocks empathy and disengages the professional to the point that it undermines judgment.  In short, compassion as a virtue is “the disposition to experience the emotion appropriately and a desire to help that is realistic” (Andre, <emphasis>Worldly Virtue</emphasis>, p. 75).</item>
 
<item>Compassion as a virtue can also be characterized as the constellation of perceptions, understandings, mental attitudes, habits, and dispositions that, over the long run, help individuals to realize and sustain the internal goods constitutive of a social or professional practice such as engineering, medicine, business, or the law.  When health care providers exercise compassion regularly and skillfully, they bring about the constitutive good of the medical profession, namely, health.</item>
    
<item>Compassion is built upon empathy, the imaginative projection of the individual into the standpoint or role of another; this projection enables an individual to see a situation as another sees it (Sherman and Piper).  Social psychologists have termed this skill, “role-taking” (G. H. Mead and David Lapsley), a skill that can be exercised properly or improperly.  Empathy is successful when it avoids two opposite pitfalls, what Adrian Piper terms empathy’s <emphasis>“Scylla and Charybdis</emphasis>.”  Scylla and Charybdis were the mythical monsters between which Greek sailors had to steer in order to stay afloat. Compassion’s version of Scylla is <emphasis>"self-absorption"</emphasis>: "one's level of imaginative involvement is, at least on the face of it, insufficiently responsive to another person's real crisis—a predicament that demands a considered and fully attentive response." Compassion’s Charybdis is <emphasis>“vicarious possession”</emphasis>: "one's level of imaginative involvement is excessively responsive to an inconsequential possibility that can be prevented easily" (Piper 733).  From this standpoint then, the mean between the extremes lies in balanced role-taking; excessive compassion fails when we become lost in the perspective of the other; defective compassion fails when efforts at projection remain stuck in the egocentric standpoint.  The virtue of compassion steers the emotion between the extremes of role-taking, i.e., between the Scylla and Charybdis of empathic projection.</item>   </list></section><section id="eip-213"><title>What you need to know: Theories of Well-Being</title><list id="eip-995"><title>Compassion and "Correct Ethical Theories"</title><item>Compassion as an emotion is feeling pain at the undeserved, sizable sufferings of individuals who fall under one's circle of concern.  As a virtue, it consists of perceptions, understandings, beliefs, attitudes, dispositions, and habits that consistently steer the emotion between the extremes of too much and too little.  But compassion also requires “correct ethical theory” as a foundation.</item>  

<item>In the following, Nussbaum argues for the importance of the supportive theories that underlie compassion (Upheavals of Thought 386): <emphasis>The objection, as Adam Smith makes it, does not deny that compassion is a valuable emotion, based in central cases on true beliefs.  The problem is that each of its judgments needs to be equipped with a correct ethical theory.  The judgment of seriousness needs a correct account of the value of external goods; the judgment of nondesert needs a correct theory of social responsibility, the eudaimonistic judgment needs a correct theory of proper concern.</emphasis></item>  

<item>A correct theory of responsibility has already been outlined in the discussion of the second appraisal of compassion above.  In this section, I wish to discuss the different approaches to well-being that underlie the appraisals of size and eudaimonism.  Well-being can be understood as (1) desire fulfillment, (2) having desirable mental states, or (3) having access to goods or capabilities that compose an "objective list" (See Brey and Harris for details).  Below is brief summary of each.</item>  

<item>After outlining these three approaches to well-being, I wish to conclude this section with a summary of Appropriate Technology and the Capability Approach.  Appropriate Technology targets well-being through aiding the responsible choice of technologies while the Capability Approach enriches well-being by integrating considerations of justice and freedom (Oosterlaken).</item> 

<item>A note on sources: Harris and Brey outline objective and subjective approaches to well-being.  Harris then moves on to discuss well-being in terms of the Capability Approach.  Harris provides a particularly insightful revision of Nussbaum’s list of 10 capabilities for use in engineering design.  1. Brey. P. (2012). “Well-being in Philosophy, Psychology, and Economics.” In P. Brey, A. Briggle, and E. Spence (Eds.) <emphasis>The Good Life in a Technological Age</emphasis>. New York: Routledge: 15-34.  2. Harris, C.E. (2015). "Engineering Responsibility for Human Well-Being," In C. Murphy et al. (Eds) <emphasis>Engineering Ethics for a Globalized World</emphasis>. Switzerland: Springer International Publishing: 91-107.  Ingrid Robeyns discusses the Capability Approach in two articles: .  Appropriate Technology is discussed by Ernst Schumacher in <emphasis>Small is Beautiful</emphasis> and Kelvin Willoughby in two sources, his book on this topic, <emphasis>Technology Choice</emphasis>, and a more recent discussion in Willoughby 2005.  
</item> </list><para id="eip-37"><title>Desire Fulfillment</title>In approaches that designate well-being as Desire Fulfillment “well-being is having one’s preferences fulfilled” (Harris 95). This approach lacks "critical force" because it takes preference statements at face value. Harris here may be referring to Sen's discussion of preference deformation where victims of misfortune, injustice, and oppression dial their preferences down to what circumstances allow. For example, in well-being surveys carried out in India, women report that they are more satisfied with their lives than men.  But this flies in the face of what we know about their lives; women are, in many instances, reduced to property, forced to marry as children, prohibited from working outside of the home, and subjected to domestic abuse.  (Consult Nussbaum’s profiles of Vasanti and Jayama in <emphasis>Women and Development</emphasis> and <emphasis>Creating Capabilities</emphasis> for real life examples.)  It is not that women are more fulfilled or that they have achieved higher levels of well-being; it is rather that they have lowered their preferences and desires to reflect what is achievable in the face of highly constraining objective circumstances.  </para><list id="eip-98"><title>Mental State Approaches</title><item>Another subjective approach states that “well-being is having desirable mental states.”  Nozick both explains and criticizes mental state approaches with a thought experiment (Nozick, <emphasis>Anarchy and State</emphasis>).  Suppose that we can choose to be hooked up to an "experience machine" in which "our brains are connected to electrodes so that we can stimulate them to produce any experience we want” (Harris 95).  This poses the question: “Would we choose to be hooked up to the experience machine if offered the opportunity?”  If we answer “yes” then well-being would be nothing more than the experiencing of pleasant mental states.  But the fact that many of us would answer “no” implies that well-being is more than just the experience of pleasant mental states; it involves understanding, meaning, and genuine encounters with others.</item>

<item>This is captured nicely in the movie, <emphasis>Matrix</emphasis>.  Cypher laments having chosen the red pill that pulled him out of the matrix and into the real world.  He chooses, instead, to be re-plugged into the Matrix.  But others (Neo, Morpheus, Trinity) elect to remain in the real world and do so aware of both alternatives.</item>

<item>A world characterized by artificially generated and pleasant mental states should be automatically preferred were well-being reducible to mental states.  But those aware of both alternatives, the real world and the experience machine, often choose the real world.  This informed choice shows that well-being is much richer and more complicated than the portraits provided by the mental states and desire fulfillment approaches.</item>
     
<item>Mental states and preference approaches to well-being are subjective.  From this standpoint, it is difficult to deal with the problems of partiality and bias.  Harris puts it this way: "<emphasis>Preferences must not be naive and untutored but rather the result of fully informed rational deliberation</emphasis>” (Harris 95). To consider candidates for this more "fully informed" and reliable account of well-being, we turn to what Harris and Brey call "objective accounts" of well-being.</item>

</list><para id="eip-280"><title>Objective List Approaches</title>To begin, one group of objective approaches holds that “well-being is the possession of some set of goods that are seen as intrinsic constituents of well-being.”  For example, Derick Parfit provides a list of constituents of well-being that includes "moral goodness, rationality activity, development of one's abilities, having children and being a good parent, knowledge, and awareness of true beauty" (Harris 96 quoting Brey 19).  Harris cites other lists.  John Rawls approaches well-being through what he terms “primary goods.”  Acquiring these “resources” is deemed necessary for well-being. </para><list id="eip-125"><title>Rawls and Primary Goods</title><item> In his famous work, <emphasis>Theory of Justice</emphasis>, the philosopher John Rawls offers an objective list of what he calls "primary goods." These emerge out of a thought experiment.  Suppose a group of rationally self-interested individuals got together and negotiated an agreement (a social contract) that would define the terms of their future cooperative relationship.  Add to this thought experiment, two further conditions.  First, the individuals entering into this negotiation would have no knowledge of the specific circumstances of their future participation; Rawls calls this a “veil of ignorance.”  The negotiations would be carried out under conditions that suspend knowledge of physical and mental attributes (natural talents) and future social circumstances (future position on a social hierarchy).  Second, assume that each party to the negotiation is rationally self-interested and define this as motivated by the goal of maximizing access to what Rawls terms “primary goods.”  This means each party to the negation would seek to maximize well-being since, for Rawls, primary goods constitute well-being.  Rawls claims that these two assumptions would drive the social contract toward an impartial view of distributive justice, that is, justice as fairness: rational self-interest + veil of ignorance = justice as fairness.  Negotiators would seek to cover all options; should they turn out rich or generously endowed with natural talents they would want a system of distribution that would reward these qualities; but should they turn out poor and handicapped, they would want a system of distribution that would secure well-being even with this range of possibilities.</item> 
 
<item>Here is a list of the primary goods Rawls identifies.  They are primary because securing them is necessary for achieving well-being.  The rationally self-interested parties to the social contract are motivated by the goal of maximizing their access to these goods.  Rawls’ list includes...
<emphasis>•	Wealth and income
•	Opportunities and Powers
•	Rights and Liberties
•	Self-Respect</emphasis></item>

<item>Negotiating for a system that distributes these primary goods under a veil of ignorance constrains the parties to the contract in the direction of impartiality.  Rawls draws two fundamental principles of distributive justice from this thought experiment:</item>

<item>•	ELP = Equal Liberties Principle: <emphasis>“First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.” “The basic liberties of citizens are, roughly speaking, political liberty (the right to vote and to be eligible for public office), together with freedom of speech and assembly; liberty of conscience and freedom of thought; freedom of the person along with the right to hold (personal) property; and freedom from arbitrary arrest and seizure as defined by the concept of the rule of law.</emphasis>” (Rawls, A Theory of Justice, pp. 60-61)</item>

<item>•	DP = Difference Principle: “<emphasis>Second: social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be to everyone’s advantage [most especially to those most disadvantaged] and, (b) attached to positions and offices open to all….</emphasis>” (Rawls, A Theory of Justice, pp. 60-61) One further point on the difference principle requires emphasis: “<emphasis>social and economic inequalities, for example inequalities of wealth and authority, are just only if they result in compensating benefits for everyone, and in particular for the least advantaged members of society.</emphasis>” (Rawls, <emphasis>A Theory of Justice</emphasis>, 14-15.)</item>

<item>Rawls treats primary goods as the ends of social cooperation.  Hence, they form the constituents of well-being and any system of justice seeks to provide for a fair distribution of these assets among all the parties to the social contract.  On the other hand, Nussbaum and Sen treat primary goods as means to be used by individuals to realize capabilities.  Capabilities represent powers or capacities that humans have that enable them to convert primary goods (as means) into active functionings.  On both accounts, then, primary goods are important to well-being.  For Rawls, primary goods are ends in that they are the primary constituents of well-being.  On the other hand, for Sen and Nussbaum, primary goods are means; they stand as resources that can be used to convert capabilities into functionings.   
</item></list></section><section id="eip-8"><title>Appropriate Technology</title><list id="eip-607"><item>Since technology provides means for realizing human goals and aspirations, it turns out to be a major factor in achieving well-being.  The Appropriate Technology (AT) framework discusses how we achieve well-being through responsible and strategic technological choice.  This section will outline the general and specific senses of Appropriate Technology and discuss the framework adherents of this view use to accomplish responsible choice in appropriate technology.</item>

<item>In its <emphasis>positive sense</emphasis>, AT assesses the fitness of a technology to a particular STS (socio-technical system). Fitness, here, can be understood in an ecological sense; the technology chosen should be compatible with the parts and the whole of the STS into which the technology is to be enacted. As Willoughby puts it, <emphasis>“An appropriate technology is defined here as a technology tailored to fit the psychosocial and biophysical context prevailing in a particular location and period</emphasis>” (Kelvin Willoughby, "Technology Choice: A Critique of the Appropriate Technology Movement," ITDG Publishing, p. 19).</item>

<item>In its <emphasis>negative sense</emphasis>, AT highlights how the values designed into technology can come into conflict with those embedded in the surrounding STS.  These conflicting values make it less likely that the technical artifact will be successfully enacted.  For example, a bicycle works well in a socio-technical environment that offers paved roads and bicycle lanes but fails in environments where these affordances are absent, e.g., in undeveloped, sandy deserts.  To take another example, cars require an infrastructure of paved highways, gas stations, automobile insurance, and automobile repair facilities.  They also require individuals who possess the skills necessary for safe driving and universally recognized “rules of the road.”  Without these supporting structures and without a set of appropriate skills possessed by humans who drive cars, they (cars) would fail to perform according to their designed function.  Willoughby captures this idea nicely in the following: <emphasis>“The inappropriateness of technology may stem from its being deployed in a context quite different to that for which it was designed, or it might be manifested in the harmful effects of technology upon class of people despite its appropriateness from the point of view of another class of people.”</emphasis> (TC 5-6)</item>

<item>In its general sense, AT matches a technology’s internal structure with the complexity of the surrounding socio-technical system.  If we identify three levels of socio-technical complexity (early, intermediate, and advanced), then we can sort out technologies into three corresponding groups: (1) those complementing basic levels of socio-technical complexity, (2) those complementing intermediate levels of socio-technical complexity, and (3) those complementing socio-technical systems that are highly complex and sophisticated.  Since technologies influence the development of a STS, it is necessary to choose a technology whose level of complexity complements those of its surroundings.  Integrating a sophisticated and complex technology into a simple and primitive STS can bring about disruptive results.  The case outlined below, “Drop by Drop,” provides an example of a technology (and an associated practice) that has disrupted the surrounding socio-technical structure.  Successful technological choice and individual and social well-being depend on fitting the technological artifact to its specific, socio-technical surroundings.</item>
   
<item>We can distinguish general and specific senses within the AT concept.  According to Willoughby, Appropriate Technology in its general sense <emphasis>“emphasizes the universal importance of examining the appropriateness of technology in each set of circumstances”</emphasis>(Willoughby 2005, 21. Quoted by Oosterlaken 2013, 119).  Oosterlaken adds, <emphasis>“the general principle approach makes no choice yet for one or the other type of appropriateness, it just claims that appropriateness is a very important consideration in all our dealings with technology.”</emphasis> This implies that the most appropriate technology may not be the most advanced; instead it is likely to be intermediate between primitive and advanced.  Technology choice should be made in a such a way as it places the targeted STS along a value-positive trajectory.</item>

</list><para id="eip-446"><title>Appropriate Technology in its Specific Sense</title>The specific sense of Appropriate Technology uses specific criteria to assess an artifact’s fitness to its socio-technical surroundings.  One list, introduced by Ernst Schumacher in Small is Beautiful and reaffirmed by Oosterlaken is the following: “In this second approach appropriate technology is given a fixed and specific interpretation, for example ecologically sound, easy to use, low-cost, low-maintenance, labor-intensive, energy efficient, etc.” (Taken from Oosterlaken et al. “Marrying the Capability Approach, Appropriate Technology and STS: The Case of Podcasting Devices in Zimbabwe,” 119-122).  Here is a description of six specific criteria:
</para><list id="eip-922"><item> <emphasis>Simplicity.</emphasis> Simplicity, generally, is the emergent characteristic of technical artifacts whose parts stand in linear relations and are loosely coupled. Complex technologies, as Charles Perrow emphasizes, are composed of systems that are “tightly coupled” and “non-linear.”  A tightly coupled system is subject to cascading accidents because breakdowns cannot be isolated; a problem in one component can spread rapidly to the other components with which it is linked.  Tightly coupled components also resist analysis using models of linear causality: one event causes another only when the surrounding system is in a certain state.  Complexity produced by systems that are tightly coupled and subject to nonlinear causal processes make them difficult to control.  This leads Charles Perrow to argue that nuclear reactor technology should be rejected because its complexity renders it especially vulnerable to chain reaction accidents. (See Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents, Living With High-Risk Technologies, Basic Books, 1985.)</item>

<item><emphasis>Decentralized.</emphasis> Willoughby and Oosterlaken both discuss this important criterion.  The activities of designing, manufacturing, operating, and decommissioning technologies should,--other things being equal—be distributed across several different agents and locations. This is important to Amish communities when they set about choosing technologies. They have chosen not to avail themselves of electrical power produced by highly centralized electric utilities; small communities are not able to exercise economic and political power sufficient to counter what can be marshalled by these highly centralized conglomerates.  For this reason, the Amish fear that such centralized technologies would overwhelm and undermine their ability to create and maintain community values such as humility, equality, simplicity, and community (Wetmore, “Amish Technology: Reinforcing Values and Building Community,” IEEE Technology and Society, Summer 2007, 11).  Connecting to a centralized system raises the specter of the technological imperative (where human activity is subordinated to imperatives for maintaining technical systems) and reverse adaptation (where human individuals adapt themselves to bring about and serve machine needs rather than vice versa).  The central point here is that simple, decentralized technologies are easier to control and direct.  (Langdon Winner discusses the technological imperative and reverse adaptation in Autonomous Technology: Technics-out-of-Control as a Theme in Political Thought, MIT Press, 1978.  See also John Ladd. (1991). Bhopal: An Essay on Moral Responsibility and Civic Virtue.  Journal of Social Philosophy, 22(1): 73-91.) </item>

<item><emphasis>Labor Intensive.</emphasis> Automation is beneficial when we are able to delegate demanding and risky tasks to machines. For example, it is wiser to use hydraulic jacks to lift heavy objects than to attempt to do so using only the powers that can be summoned through the human body; the hydraulic jack magnifies the powers of the human body and makes it possible to expand the range of effective action.  But automation can deskill, dehumanize, and alienate humans when it is pushed too far; it can deprive humans of the opportunity to develop their own natural skills and talents. Appropriate technologies are labor intensive in the sense that they encourage the development of “actor networks” where humans and machines combine in complementary ways to complete tasks important for well-being.  Machines should complement and enhance human activities rather than replace them.</item>

<item><emphasis>Gentle in the use of resources.</emphasis> This stands for resource use that is environmentally friendly and sustainable over the long haul.  For example, wind turbines are more appropriate than coal-fired electricity plants because the former uses renewable resources (wind) while the latter depletes the finite resource of coal which is harvested by invasive mining.  “Gentle in the use of resources” indicates methods of resource extraction and use that are environmental friendly and sustainable. </item>

<item><emphasis>Serves people</emphasis> (and not the other way around). This is another way of saying a technical artifact should be designed, operated, and disposed of deploying knowledge and skill that are within the capabilities of those living in the community in which it operates.  Lewis Mumford would term technologies that serve people as “democratic” technics, and he distinguishes these from “authoritarian” technics.  “My thesis, to put it bluntly, is that from late Neolithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side-by-side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak but resourceful and durable.”  Democratic technics, by definition, serve people while authoritarian technics, again by definition, subordinate people to machine ends. The Amish make this an important consideration in their approach to responsible technology choice.  In technology choice, the Amish strive to ensure that the chosen artifact does not displace or push to the side important community values and activities; technologies should support the community and its values rather than undermine and displace them.</item>

<item><emphasis>Low cost and low maintenance</emphasis> also relates directly to control. Fernandez et al. show how cost of operation and ease of maintenance turns out to be critical factors in the successful implementation of micro hydro power plants in a developing communities.  The Chucura Project constructed for a rural community near La Paz, Bolivia, fell into disuse because it had been designed without local input; its operation was too expensive and its maintenance required skill and knowledge beyond what was available locally.  On the other hand, this same technical artifact was successfully integrated in other circumstances because the involvement of local stakeholders helped to ensure that the enactment of the technology was commensurate with local resources and capabilities.  </item>

</list><para id="eip-22">Appropriate Technology contributes to the understanding of well-being in that it provides a framework for technology choice that emphasizes fitting the technology to the surrounding socio-technical system.  It steers us away from technologies that are disruptive and towards technologies that reinforce important values and enhance human capabilities.  Finally, AT advocates choosing technologies that serve human ends rather than those that (due to complexity and centralization) supplant human values and subordinate human activities to technological ends.    </para></section><section id="eip-333"><title>Capability Approach: An Introduction</title><para id="eip-579">The Capability Approach to well-being picks up where Rawls left off.  It avoids the pitfalls of the subjective approaches, especially the problem of preference deformation.  And it recognizes the importance of primary goods but reinterprets them as means to ends that are spelled out in terms of central human potentialities.  In fact, the Capability Approach can be summarized through six characteristics: capabilities consist of vulnerable powers, represent fundamental human beings and doings, stand in a one-to-many relation to functionings, exhibit nonlinear causality, provide a lens for technology assessment, and emphasize agency over need.  The following image, called the Capability Triangle, provides a convenient way of summarizing this approach to well-being.

  <image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/Capability Triangle.jpg"/>
		 
</media></para><list id="eip-662"><title>A Summary of the Capability Approach</title><item><emphasis>1. Capabilities are vulnerable powers that make claims on the socio-technical environment for their realization</emphasis>. This follows from an Aristotelian conception of humans as rational animals that realize themselves by performing certain essential activities.  As Nussbaum puts it, “This [human] being comes into the world characterized by certain basic powers and by amazing neediness—by rich neediness … in the sense that the very powers of this being exist as needs for fulfillment and claim, for their fully human development, rich support from the human and the natural world” (Aristotelian Social Democracy, 243).  Practical reasoning provides an excellent example.  This capability consists of the power of setting goals then organizing preferences and desires as well as means and resources for the realization of these goals.  But this important human capability is vulnerable; it must be developed through guided practice and it must be protected from disease, injury, and outside interference. 
</item>

<item><emphasis>2. Capabilities are beings and doings. As beings they refer to well-being and states of flourishing and happiness.</emphasis> For example, humans seek to be healthy.  Humans also engage in activities (doings); they move about within their surroundings, acquire knowledge, engage in aesthetic activity, and join with others to build social groups and organizations.  Doings (acting within our surroundings to transform them) highlight the importance of agency, freedom, and choice to the Capability Approach.  In this way, the Capability Approach provides the “correct theory” of well-being that supports the emotion and virtue of compassion.  But it interprets well-being as the active exercise of characteristic human activities (beings and doings) rather than the passive enjoyment of consumables (often termed positional goods).  Humans still have needs that must be fulfilled but these are reformulated as the “needy powers” that Nussbaum describes in the passage quoted above. </item>

<item><emphasis>3. The relation between capabilities as powers and their specific realizations or functionings is a one-many relation.</emphasis> Capabilities are general potentialities.  But these potentialities can be actualized in different ways depending on an individual’s strengths and weaknesses and on the ways in which surrounding STS constrains and enables activity.  For example, humans can move (capability) in many different ways each of which can be termed a functioning: (1) riding a bicycle, (2) flying an airplane, (3) driving a car, (4) riding a horse, (5) walking, (6) running, (7) skating, etc. This one-many relation between capabilities and functionings is important for understanding agency and freedom.  Freedom is a function of the ratio of capabilities to functionings; the more functionings available for realizing a given capability, the greater the scope and magnitude of freedom.  The goal of development, under this view, becomes, not increasing the quantity of positional goods to be consumed by individuals, but multiplying the different ways people have of exercising agency by choosing and realizing capabilities.</item>

<item><emphasis>4. Capabilities work through contextual, not linear, causation.</emphasis> A (=capability) causes B (=functioning) only in context C (=STS that offers positive conversion factors). As Oosterlaken puts it in Technology and Human Development, <emphasis>“The idea is that the conventional notion of causality (‘if a then b”) is replaced with a “contextual causality’ in the sense of “x causes y’ (in circumstances c). Individual capabilities are interpreted as a type of causal power in this view.”</emphasis>  This is important for two reasons.  First, implementing the Capability Approach as a measure of well-being requires approaching well-being as a functioning within a system; it requires, in short, systems thinking.  Second, if capability A cannot be realized through functioning B, then one must alter one’s circumstances.  One begins by examining how the surrounding STS constrains and enables the conversion of capabilities into functionings; then one identifies ways that individuals can empower themselves to multiply functionings and how surroundings can be altered so that they provide affordances for converting capabilities into functionings.</item>

<item><emphasis>5. The Capability Approach is a lens for technology assessment.</emphasis>  The Capability Approach allows us to assess technology-driven development projects in terms of their impact on key capabilities.  For example, consider the different technologies offered for energy generation.  Amory Lovins groups these into soft and hard paths; soft paths are more environmentally friendly and use renewable resources while hard paths have more destructive environmental consequences and deploy non-renewable resources.  Responsible technological choice in the realm of energy production could be driven by a framework that assesses different technologies in terms of their impact on capabilities like bodily health, bodily integrity, practical reasoning, other species, and control over environment.  Energy generating technical artifacts, as they become enrolled into socio-technical systems, can be assessed in terms of how they constrain and/or enable the conversion of capability into functioning.  Does burning coal lead to pollution that causes respiratory problems?  If so, then it is capability-contracting in that it diminishes bodily health.  Does the use of technologies that depend on renewable resources such as sun and wind lead to functionings that are more consistent with other species, i.e., have positive impacts on the surrounding natural environment?  The Capability Approach provides a lens for technological assessment by measuring the impact of a technology on a framework of basic capabilities.  Consider another example: the Gulf Oil refinery located in Cataño, Puerto Rico can be evaluated from the standpoint of the capability of bodily health. Those living near the facility (when it was in operation) suffered disproportionately from respiratory problems caused by the toxic emissions; the refinery, through its pollution, contracted or constrained the expression of the capability of bodily health. When the facility was decommissioned and converted into a storage facility, further problems were created by unsafe practices enacted by those in charge of maintaining the facility. As a result, an explosion occurred in October 2009 that destroyed 21 of the facility’s 40 storage tanks. This explosion, connected to lapses in safety practices, clearly diminished the capabilities of local residences of life and health. Thus, working from a list such as Nussbaum’s list, one can identify relevant capabilities and examine the impact of a technical artifact; one imaginatively projects it into a STS and determines whether it is capability-expanding or capability-contracting.</item>

<item><emphasis>6. The capability approach emphasizes agency over need. In fact, the capability approach “provides a powerful conceptual framework to assess and evaluate technology in terms of” the values of well-being, agency, and justice.</emphasis> (Oosterlaken, 9) Together, the 10 capabilities that comprise Nussbaum’s list provide a general outline of well-being. Each capability outlines what it means to flourish within a particular “form of human life.” Taken together, they outline a life of human flourishing and dignity.  As mentioned above, there is a one-many relation between a capability and the corresponding set of functionings. The capability of movement can be expressed through many functionings; one can walk, skate, ride a bicycle, run, drive a car, take a train, and so forth. The conversion of a capability into a functioning requires the exercise of choice and agency. Thus each capability outlines a zone of agency and expresses freedom through choice. In other words, the capabilities approach has as much to do with agency and freedom as it has with well-being. Finally, capabilities can be formulated to outline a minimal threshold of social justice. A lifespan of 60 years (for life), breathable air (for health), and the ability to move by car safely and unhindered throughout one’s living environment (for bodily integrity) would together lay out the beginnings of a threshold of minimum social justice. The Capability Approach makes it possible to assess energy generation technology in terms of their impact on the ability of individuals to maintain themselves above this minimum threshold. It provides a comparative basis where one could compare and assess different technical artifacts as well as different societies or communities.  </item>
</list><list id="eip-303"><title>A Sidebar on the Vulnerability of Practical Reasoning</title><item>Damasio, a neurologist, studies patients who, due to injuries to certain regions of the brain, are unable to prioritize options and make choices and commitments.  In his book, Descartes’ Error, he studies two individuals whose ability to carry out practical reasoning was compromised by brain injuries.  Both patients continued to exhibit intelligence; one tested well on IQ and other intelligence tests.  Nevertheless, they were unable to make decisions because they were flooded with irrelevant or even bad alternatives and found themselves unable to filter, evaluate, and rank these possibilities. This inability to “prune the decision tree” has been termed the frame problem (De Sousa and Wallach and Allen).</item>
 
<item>Damasio puts forth a “somatic marker hypothesis” to explain how normal individuals solve the frame problem.  Alternatives that stand before individuals making decisions are “marked” with positive or negative emotional valences.  This makes it possible to eliminate those marked negatively and helps individuals hone in on fruitful possibilities marked with a positive emotional valence.  Wallach and Allen apply this hypothesis to developing robots with practical reasoning capabilities.  Emotions help humans solve the frame problem by marking alternatives as good or bad based on past experience; robots would have to be designed with a similar mechanism that quickly marked and ranked decision alternatives.   Here is how Wallach and Allen put it: <emphasis>“Collectively…the somatic markers can also be seen as framing the territory of considerations that need to be factored into a judgment.  A somatic marker system prunes the decision tree and thereby facilitates decision making.  Looked at from another perspective, the network of interrelated somatic markers can be thought of as providing scaffolding on which the capacity for reason is built.”</emphasis>  These markers, provided by emotions, help decision making by tagging present experiences with memories of past experiences, especially bad experiences.  This, again, prunes the decision tree and helps decision makers who have brains hone in on exactly the most relevant and pertinent considerations.</item>
  
<item>Practical reason uses emotion and perception to solve the frame problem.  It is an essential human trait but is also vulnerable because it makes use of cognitive-emotional functions that are housed in particular areas of the brain and thus vulnerable to injury.  Practical reason also requires favorable socio-technical surroundings.  These surroundings provide affordances that help reasoning agents realize goals and execute plans.  Should the surrounding environment withhold affordances or even manifest characteristics that block action, then practical reason fails to function.  The Capability Approach captures all of these aspects: the vulnerability of human powers; the possibility of pushing back this vulnerability through the development of knowledge and skill; the importance of socio-technical surroundings which can either aid or impede the expression of capabilities.</item>
  
</list><para id="eip-698"><title>A Sidebar on food security and bodily health</title>We can give a hungry individual a fish to eat; this would provide temporary satisfaction to the ongoing biological challenge of sustaining biological well-being.  Food security is a capability and eating fish is a functioning of this capability.  But the Capability Approach emphasizes multiplying the functionings that realize or express a given capability.  So, instead of giving an individual a fish to eat, we can teach an individual to fish, thus, further empowering him or her by reducing dependency on our generosity.  We can expand even further this capability of food security by providing affordances or conversion factors that magnify an individual’s power to fish by giving him or her a boat, a fishing pole, a fishing net, and a wood-burning stove to cook the fish.  Teaching individuals to fish and providing them with tools and technologies to fish with empowers because it increases the set of functionings that correspond to the capability of food security; there are now more ways to realize this capability.  And the Capability Approach encourages us to think even further outside of the box: why restrict ourselves to eating fish when identifying the set of functionings that realize the capability of food security?  Agricultural practices have expanded food security to include plants that have been altered to become better sources of food, different options for generating and consuming meat, along with techniques for growing and harvesting food in a long-term sustainable way.  The point is that the Capability Approach identifies human needs and then reformulates these as powers or potentialities.  Accompanying each capability are beings and doings which constitute functionings: specific activities that realize capabilities in concrete situations.  The goal of development has been transformed from that of providing goods to temporarily solve needs (a short-term response that reinforces passivity) to that of expanding the capacity to act for oneself by increasing the set of functionings that can realize a given capability.

<item>Note.  Nussbaum’s list of 10 capabilities is a good place to start. 
 But there are other capabilities lists.  For example, Robeyns provides a useful list of 15 capabilities while Walker outlines key capabilities for education.</item>

</list><list id="eip-555"><title>_How can Capabilities Lists be Validated</title><item>In an article critical of Nussbaum’s list of capabilities (and of Nussbaum’s approach in general) Allison Jagger cites four methods used by Nussbaum to identify and justify the capabilities that are central to human well-being.  What makes Nussbaum’s list of 10 capabilities objective?  Nussbaum main argument here is that these ten capabilities belong to a “thick, vague conception of the good.”  According to Jagger, Nussbaum uses four different methods to justify the capabilities she derives from this “thick, vague conception of the good.”</item>

<item>1.	<emphasis>Myths and stories.</emphasis> What are the characteristics, traits, and qualities in terms of which we define the human being? Stories and myths helps us to answer this question by providing thought experiments in which we add or subtract qualities we use to define humans.  For example, the heroes of Greek mythology, like Hercules, are given characteristics that make them super-human; Hercules is endowed with super-human strength and immortality.  Is he still human after being endowed with these qualities?  Can an immortal being feel compassion for a human when it no longer shares human vulnerabilities?  On the other hand, Homer’s mythical being, the Cyclops, resemble humans but they lack the key attribute of paidea, namely, the ability to behave in a civilized, educated manner.  The question now arises as to whether beings that lack paidea but otherwise share human characteristics can still be considered human.  If not, then paidea is an essential human characteristic and, under the Capability Approach, can be reformulated as the capability of education.  How much can we vary this thick notion of humanness before it is transformed into something else, whether godlike or beastlike?  These thought experiments resonate with recent research into the radial structure of thick concepts like humanness.  We identify paradigmatic instances of these concepts and then work to draw analogies between these paradigmatic instances and those that are more problematic because they lack some of the characteristics of the paradigms.  Myths and stories are not just diversions but tools that we use to explore the boundaries of thick moral, political, social, and economic concepts.</item>
    
<item>2.	<emphasis>Narrative method.</emphasis> In Women and Development and again in Creating Capabilities, Nussbaum provides short narrative profiles of real individuals. Vasanti and Jayama, two severely oppressed women from India, are portrayed to outline a basic threshold of social justice.  These profiles show individuals struggling to realize readily identifiable capabilities like “control over environment.”  They also can be used to establish thresholds of well-being.  Vasanti is deprived of the opportunity to go to school, is not allowed to have children, and cannot leave the house to work; she is physically abused by her husband.  Jayama works in a physically demanding job, is paid less than men who perform similar labors, and is denied support when she is too old to work.  These narratives provides concrete examples of humans who fall below the threshold of a minimally decent life.  We can understand these thresholds in terms of capabilities; then we can outline these capabilities using indicators that allow us to specify when an individual has fallen below a key capability and thus deprived of dignity and well-being.</item>
  
<item>3.	<emphasis>Zones of Human Existence.</emphasis> Stories, myths, case studies and personal profiles show reoccurring themes: mortality, the vulnerable body, sentiency (pain and pleasure), imagination, sociability, and separateness. We can use these themes to identify forms of human life or zones of human existence; capabilities then emerge as descriptions of what it means to flourish within each zone. This represents the most prevalent method Nussbaum used to identify capabilities in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</item>

<item>4.	<emphasis>Functional descriptions of human activities</emphasis>. For the Greeks, each thing (not just living things) has its proper form of functioning. This functioning, a characteristic activity, represents the nature (physis) of the things in question. Capabilities form a set that gives us insight into the proper nature of the human being, not in the form of a static essence, but in the form of a series of activities or functionings through which this nature is realized. This functional description of the human being naturally lends itself to the language of the capability approach. Capabilities are human potentials and outline how to flourish in different zones of human existence. Functionings are the ways in which capabilities are realized in the here and now through specific activities carried out in specific contexts.</item>

<item>A correct theory of well-being helps to guide the emotion of compassion between extremes of excess and defect.  They are especially pertinent to the empathic projection that forms the core of compassion and help us avoid the pitfalls of this projection that Piper terms its Scylla and Charybdis.  Subjective list approaches provide a good start; here individuals report on their perceptions of how their lives are going.  But because these subjective approaches fall prey to preference deformation, they need to be further examined in terms of objectively established approaches to well-being such as Rawls’ account of primary goods, Appropriate Technology with its emphasis on the fitness to socio-technical surroundings, and the Capability Approach with its emphasis on fundamental human activities, i.e., beings and doings that flesh out the abstract notions of flourishing and well-being.

The metaphor in the framework below that has the student zoom in and zoom out from artifact to socio-technical surroundings is one of many example.  Oosterlaken unpacks this metaphor in her book Technology and Human Development, Routledge, 2015.  (See below for the complete reference.)</para><list id="eip-970"><title>1. Zoom In</title><item>1.	<emphasis>Zoom-in.</emphasis>  Here you will focus on describing the technology, product, or service that serves as the focus of your case? </item>

<item>This framework for zooming in on individual technologies is taken from Vermass et al., The Philosophy of Technology (Morgan and Claypool publishers.)  They distinguish between the structure of a technical artifact and its active functioning within a socio-technical system.  (To get at a functional description, they recommend providing a “user’s guide,” that is a set of instruction on how to use the technical artifact in question.)  They also hold that technical artifacts are inseparable from the socio-technical systems in which they operate.  This becomes clear when they discuss the socio-technical system within which the airplane is designed to function.  Study also how they distinguish artifacts from natural objects.</item>
    
</list><list id="eip-821"><title>2. Zoom Out</title><item>2.	Zoom-out.  What is the surrounding socio-technical system?  Socio-technical systems have five characteristics.</item>
  
<item>First, they are surroundings and circumstances that have considerable impact on human agency.  This can be unpacked by understanding how they constrain action in some ways and expand or empower it in others.</item>
  
<item>Second, socio-technical systems can be analyzed into sub-environments such as hardware, software, physical surroundings or geography, procedures, people/groups/roles, laws/statutes/regulations, and information systems?  What are the sub-environments that compose a given socio-technical system, and how do these individually constrain and enable human action?</item>
  
<item>Third, even though STSs have parts, these parts are interrelated and interact with one another.  In other words, our socio-technical surroundings form systems and need to be approached through systems thinking.  A clear example of how socio-technical surroundings take the form of systems and the important role played in these systems by feedback loops is provided by Peter Senge’s important book, <emphasis>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</emphasis>.  In the Lover’s Beer example, we see how linear thinking ignores key feedback loops and thus leads to a breakdown in the coordination between customers, who create demand, and retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers, who respond to demand.  Senge uses this example when teaching organizational theory at MIT.</item>
   
<item>Socio-technical systems embody values.  Changes occur when the system or the technology is modified to resolve conflicts between the values of a technical or social artifact and those embedded in the STS.  We can identify these conflicts through description and analysis of the interacting parts.  We can also identify the different "localities” within a STS where a particular value is realized.  For example, privacy may be secured through physical modifications (doors and locks), norms, laws, and information practices.</item>

<item>Finally, STSs change as a result of external causes such as interactions with other socio-technical systems.  These changes trace out paths or trajectories.  The goal of STS analysis is to discoverer or design ways to place a STS on a value-positive trajectory</item>

</list><para id="eip-805"><title>3. Appropriate Technology</title>3.	<emphasis>Appropriate Technology.</emphasis>  Take the six criteria of Appropriate Technology and discuss the technology, product or service on which your case focuses.  Is it (1) simple, (2) decentralized, (3) gentle in its use of resources, (4) serves people and not other way around, (5) low cost/maintenance, and (6) labor intensive?  While a technical artifact can be assessed directly by discussing how it stands in relation to these criteria, it is often better to compare two or more artifacts in terms of these criteria.  For example, how do cogenerating plants compare with wind turbines in terms of whether they are gentle in their use of natural resources?    </para><para id="eip-51"><title>4. Capability Approach</title>4.	<emphasis>Capability Approach</emphasis>.  From Nussbaum's list of capabilities, identify 4 or 5 that are pertinent to the case at hand.  Identify indicators within each capability that can be measured.  Does the artifact, service, or product enhance (expand) or contract the capabilities you have chosen?  For example, one could identify five capabilities and use these to compare different energy generation technologies.  How does cogeneration technology compare to wind turbines in terms of the capabilities of bodily health, other species, practical reason, affiliation, and control over environment.  This comparative analysis—what I am calling a Capability Approach matrix—is more powerful than a discussion that applies capabilities to just one technical artifact.  Capabilities can be further specified in terms of indicators.  These measurable elements can be used to establish capability thresholds; falling below a threshold then indicates a failure in maintaining social justice and triggers the need to bring about remedial action.  Severine Deneulin looks at well-being in a poor neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  She identifies capabilities like education and then provides different indicators that allow one to see key thresholds in education.  One indicator, for example, is the percentage of children in different neighborhoods who have graduated from high school.  A key indicator for the capability of bodily health might be the percentage of individuals who have health insurance.  In general, this section of the framework has you compare different technical artifacts in terms of whether they expand or contract capability “space.”  </para><para id="eip-891">

Those causing the harms are usually unaware of this because these harms are wrought collectively rather than individually.

But when my individual actions are aggregated with similar actions of others into substantially large collective actions, then the consequences taken at this level may be substantial.  Globalization has made such collectivities possible; it stands for increased transportation and communication capabilities that, in turn, make it easier to draw individual actions together into collective action networks.  Thus, globalization has created the need to recognize a new kind of sizable misfortune, namely, new harms.  Issues of distributive justice loom large when we discuss new harms.  In Drop-by-Drop, we see how consumers in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engage in consumption practices that benefit wealthy asparagus farmers in Peru at the expense of indigenous substance farmers in the mountains of that same country.  New harms also pose challenges to those who seek remedial means.  See Virginia Held’s famous essay on when isolated individuals are responsible for joining together and acting in tandem to respond collectively to collectively-wrought new harms.</item>

<item>Deneulin’s discussion of this case shows (1) how pertinent the Capability Approach is to formulating problems of well-being such as those created by the emergence of new harms and (2) that well-being concerns quickly pivot to problems of regional autonomy and social justice.  The indigenous farmers of Peru are certainly the subjects of compassion.  (In working through why this would be the case, run the situation of these farmers through the three appraisals of compassion.)  But they are also occasions for anger; is their suffering the result of intentional wrongful actions performed by others?   Anger issues in two responses: vengeance (payback) and moving forward (bringing about moral repair) (Nussbaum).  Which response is appropriate in this case?  Should one respond with anger or compassion or both?  Consult the module on anger published in Connexions ® to find out more about anger’s constitutive appraisals.  Note that the object of anger resembles that of compassion; each foregrounds sizable suffering but from different points of view.

</list><list id="eip-603"><title>Here are some facts about asparagus farming in Peru:</title><item>•	The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have promoted growing asparagus in dry regions of Peru as a cash crop to stimulate the local economy and promote economic development.</item>

<item>Three harms stand out: (1) the depletion of the water table in a particularly dry sector of South America, (2) the displacement of indigenous farmers because water they require is being diverted to irrigate fields of asparagus, and (3) a redistribution of economic costs and benefits in such a way that the indigenous inhabitants of these communities are alienated and marginalized.  The net result of this project is exporting water from the desert areas of Peru to northern countries where water is plentiful.</item>

<item>Exporting asparagus has promoted development for select segments of the Peruvian population at the expense of the economic well-being of other groups.  While it has made it possible for consumers in Great Britain, the United States and the Netherlands to enjoy fresh asparagus year-around, this benefit has come at the expense of indigenous farmers and their small communities.</item>

</list><para id="eip-702">Collectively-wrought harms require organized, collective responses.  If I stop eating asparagus, this will hardly improve the situation of indigenous farmers in Peru; the impact of actions that I can undertake by myself in this context is insignificant.  On the other hand, if I organize with others and collectively we stop eating asparagus, then this boycott stands to have a substantial impact on asparagus growing in Peru.  Just what this impact will be depends on a lot of factors which should be enumerated and debated.  But Lichtenberg’s point is that there are occasions in which individuals become responsible for organizing into collectivities that can respond to new harms in a concerted, coordinated fashion.  Lichtenberg draws on the work of Virginia Held to identify the conditions under which disassociated individuals are morally responsible for organizing and acting in tandem to respond collectively and effectively to a problematic situation.  This general argument has strong implications for responding to global warming, political oppression, and economic inequality. Lichtenberg also discusses how important it is for consumer ethics where phenomena such as the “demonstration effect” (Dusenberry) and “ability signaling” (Cortina, Crocker, and Lichtenberg).   </para></section><section id="eip-847"><title>Making iPhones and Computers in China</title><list id="eip-945"><item>The radio program, <emphasis>This American Life</emphasis>, provides highlights from the popular dramatization performed by Mike Daisey on the plight of workers in Foxconn factories in China.  These workers manufacture the components for Apple iPhones as well as the components for other ICTs (information and communication technology).  Daisey designed his presentation to evoke compassion for Foxconn workers who endure long shifts, live in squalid dormitories, and work in factories that are unsafe and poorly ventilated.  Listen to the excerpts from Daisey’s presentation to see if you can spot appeals to compassion’s appraisals of size, nondesert, and circle of concern.</item> 

<item>After broadcasting Daisey’s presentation, reporters for <emphasis>This American Life</emphasis> found that Daisey had fabricated many parts of his narrative, especially his description of his visit to Foxconn plants and interviews he claimed to have conducted with the workers in those plants. The URL below links to This American Life’s retraction of their previous broadcast along with a section where, under questioning, Daisey admitted to significant fabrications in his drama.  At the end of the tape there is a short and illuminating interview with Charles Duhigg, a <emphasis>New York Times</emphasis> reporter who published a series of stories on the plight of workers at Foxconn. While Duhigg's reporting does not support many of the claims Daisey makes in his presentation, it does substantiate provide a general picture of deplorable working conditions at Foxconn. (Duhigg hedges on the issue as to whether these conditions merit a boycott of Apple products claiming in so many words that he is a journalist, not an ethicist.)  Duhigg also provides an analysis of why Foxconn is so successful in manufacturing business components and how STS conditions in China are conducive to the efficient and profitable manufacture of computer and ICT components.  As it turns out there are some very good reasons why Apple and other ICT components cannot be as effectively and efficiently manufactured in Silicon Valley as they are in China.  Listen to the last part of <emphasis>This American Life's</emphasis> retraction and read the series published in the <emphasis>New York Times</emphasis> by Duhigg. Are workers at Foxconn legitimate recipients of our compassion? Should we be angry at their plight and the injustice it implies?  Focus specifically on Nussbaum's characterization of compassion's “eudaimonistic” judgment. Even though they are distant strangers, are Foxconn workers a part of our “circle of concern” and, therefore, the proper subjects of our compassion?  
</item></list><list id="eip-950"><title>Here are some of the characterizations that both Daisey and Duhigg set forth about working conditions at Foxconn factories in China</title><item>Foxconn workers have suffered from neurological damage after using n-hexane to polish the glass surfaces of Apple iPhones.  This substance was used because it evaporates more quickly than alcohol and is, therefore, more efficient in the manufacturing process.</item>
  
<item>Duhigg shows how Foxconn contributes, as a supplier, to Apple’s success.  For example, they are able to respond quickly to design changes by retooling the machinery in one plant and then coordinating with other plants in the immediate vicinity to implement changes across the manufacturing process.</item>
  
<item>Explosive fires produced by aluminum dust combined with improper ventilation to cause worker injuries and deaths from dust explosions and fires.  What stands out is that Foxconn did not respond quickly to this easily preventable problem; they did not learn from the accidents that occurred.  The aluminum dust was caused by workers polishing the aluminum containers of Apple devices; the accumulation of dust in dangerous concentrations in the air could easily have been prevented by the installation of cheap, ventilation fans.  Yet it took multiple occurrences of this accident before Foxconn decided to respond to the problem.</item>
    
<item>Foxconn workers endured harsh working conditions including excessively long work days and were frequently required to work back-to-back, 12-hour shifts.  During this time they were required to stand or sit in chairs without backs.  These conditions would not be tolerated in factories in the West; in many instances they violated the standards that Apple had set for their suppliers.  What responsibilities do companies like Apple have for matters like the working conditions in the plants of their suppliers?  Are they limited to setting standards?  Can these standards be enforced?  What leverage does Apple have over Foxconn that would allow it to enforce these standards?  These and other questions arise in the context of the responsibilities Apple bears toward Foxconn workers.  What are these and how can they be carried out?  In general, to what extent is it ethically permissible for companies like Apple to benefit from outsourcing much of their manufacturing to companies like Foxconn that present lower labor costs, provide greater flexibility and efficiency, and operate in nations with lower labor, environmental, and safety standards? </item>
   
<item>Employees working at Foxconn are housed in unpleasant and crowded dorms.  Worker suicides have been attributed to deplorable working and living conditions. What are Apple responsibilities for setting standards that prescribe decent living and working conditions?  Apple argues that they have no such responsibilities because of the detailed monitoring and surveillance they would require, and because they have no right to dictate to their foreign suppliers how to operate their plants and manage their employees.</item>
  
<item>What is the moral significance of the different health, environmental, labor, and safety standards held by the global north and the global south?    Does the dictum, “When in Rome do as the Romans do?” apply here?  Or are there transnational, moral standards that must be recognized and enforced by multinational corporations like Apple?</item>
    
<item>Would you be willing to pay more for Apple products if this would help establish better working conditions for Foxconn workers?  How much more?  Duhigg argues that Apple consumers save anywhere from 10 to 65 dollars on the purchase of iPhones.  Do these savings justify the means by which they are brought about?</item>
  
<item>Is Daisey justified in fabricating some of the elements of his presentation, if he is doing so to make the case for compassion for Foxconn workers?  The deplorable working and living conditions at Foxconn are generally true as Duhigg’s reporting makes clear.  But the particulars of Daisey’s presentation are, for the most part, fabricated.  Compassion requires specificity, that is, it requires telescoping the general, statistical reporting of Duhigg into the concrete images and events that form the subject matter of Daisey’s presentation.  Can Daisey’s fabrications be justified as a necessary means to the moral end of evoking compassion for the plight of the Foxconn workers who manufacture the devices that we enjoy?</item></list><para id="eip-778">This is a complicated case.  In the course, Introduction to Business, Management, and Ethics, it has been approached through an encuentro, a face-to-face discussion framed around whether Apple products should be boycotted to force Apple to exercise more control over its supplier, Foxconn.  What is important is that there are serious and credible considerations on both sides of this issue.  Should compassion be extended to Foxconn workers given their working conditions, their low salaries in comparison with those of us in the West, and the fact that many of them are not able to enjoy the devices they help to manufacture?</para></section><section id="eip-739"><title>Case 3: One Laptop Per Child</title><para id="eip-720">This case focuses on XO laptops (designed by MIT engineers and manufactured in Taiwan).  The One Laptop Per Child initiative, based on a not-for-profit distribution model, was founded as a social business to make simple, cheap, but effective laptop computers to sell to governments in developing nations for distribution to school children. The computers connect easily to the Internet, are made of cheap durable components, contain educational software for self-learning, and provide a ready means of digitalizing textbooks and educational materials. The project, however, has had trouble with teacher resistance and surprisingly sharp competition from for-profit organizations like Dell, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel.  This case poses an interesting series of problems.  For instance, are the educational capabilities targeted by these laptop computers best brought about by for-profit or not-for-profit business strategies?  Are these laptops examples of participatory and value sensitive design or are they technical artifacts designed in a university lab that are, more-or-less, solutions looking for problems?

<item>Ted Talk: Negroponte’s argument—the potential of this technology and its individualized learning model to bridge learning gap between children in North and South</item>
</list><list id="eip-870"><title>Problems and Considerations</title><item>•	What impact does the XL Laptop have on the capabilities of learning and play?  Do these two capabilities conflict with one another in the context of OLPC?  Consider reports that students use their laptops to chat with one another (the capability of affiliation) or to play games (the capability of play).  In your judgment, do these activities “crowd out” the learning activities that the laptops were designed to bring about?</item>

<item>Teachers object to the individualized learning model embodied in OLPC machine and software designs.  These teachers have, up to this point, used collective and cooperative learning approaches in their classrooms.  Do technical artifacts like computers embody values or favor practices like individualized learning?  Or are technical artifacts value neutral and take on values only through being deployed toward external ends or purposes?  If teachers are trained primarily to bring about collective learning, is it a violation of their professional autonomy to adopt a different, individualized approach?</item>
  
<item>Several of my students have worked with OLPC computers and Sugar software learning products.  They argue that it is difficult to install the designated operating system on these laptops.  They also find that it is difficult to provide training and technical support to students and teachers who must use these technical artifacts.  Students find the software biased toward Western culture; for example, students in Africa found that software designed to help them compose music did not recognize local music forms.  Finally, educational bureaucracies are reluctant to use OLPC technologies because their students will still have to learn how to work with widely disseminated products such as those provided by Microsoft and Apple.  Do these concerns provide definitive arguments against the manufacture, distribution, and use of OLPC ICTs?</item>

<item>Competition from for-profits: Dell, HP, Acer has been vigorous.  This suggests that there is a market, even in poor regions, for laptop computers and other ICTs.  What is the best strategy for designing, manufacturing, distributing, and using ICTs?  Are for-profit models more efficient and cost-effective?  Are they more responsive to issues in distributive and social justice?  Or are there problems with distributive and social justice when we depend solely on markets to distribute the goods and services related to education?  What is being distributed in this case: positional goods such as technical artifacts or non-positional goods such as education?  (Albert Borgmann and Martha Nussbaum provide useful discussions on the different types of goods and the different methods of distribution they favor.)  Finally, which is the best method for manufacturing and distributing ICTs: for profit or not-for-profit or some combination of the two?</item></list></section><section id="eip-428"><title>Case 4: Podcasting in Zimbabwe</title><list id="eip-941"><item>An NGO (Practical Action) with funds from Practical Action and HIVOS has tested podcasting as means of getting information to isolated subsistence farmers. This includes information on local agricultural markets (prices) as well as veterinary advice (how to treat sick “livestock”). This case study can be reviewed by downloading the report submitted by Practical action entitled, PODCASTING: End-of-Pilot Project Report, 1st October 2008 – 31st March 2009. Submitted to HIVOS, PROJECT NUMBER: QC005H16. Compiled by: Lawrence D Gudza URL: https://practicalaction.org/docs/new_technologies/Final_Project_Report_HIVOS_2009.pdf. The article on podcasting by Oosterlaken et al. (see references below) provides a comprehensive analysis of this project in terms of the Capabilities Approach.</item>

<item>Podcasting in Zimbabwe represents another example of a compassion case if one views it as an occasion to use responsible technical choice to combat a sizable misfortune.  Farmers in the targeted areas of Zimbabwe have faced challenges due to their isolation from other communities, lack of education, and illiteracy.</item>  

<item>The podcast project carried out by Practical Action also provides a localized response to a community-specific problem: <emphasis>How can local farmers be provided with information on animal care as well as up-to-date information on market prices for agricultural products?</emphasis></item>  

<item>The article by Oosterlaken et al. offers a promising framework for assessing appropriate technology projects.  <emphasis>What impact will adopting this technology have on the capabilities that are important to members of this community?</emphasis>  Here the Capability Approach stands in for well-being; the constituents for well-being are the capabilities that represent activities vitally important to community members.  Crucial capabilities can be identified working with community members by using an “opportunity detection kit” (Mink et al.).  These capabilities can then be further specified by identifying indicators (Deneulin).  For example, the capability of education can be fleshed out in terms of indicators such as rates of graduation from high school.  The advantage of indicators is that they are measurable; in this way capabilities can be unpacked in terms of quantitatively determinable content.  Identifying key capabilities and their measurable indicators provides a useful procedure for assessing the success of an appropriate technology like the Podcasting in Zimbabwe project.  Animal health might be used as a measurable indicator for the capability of food security.  How would one measure the impact of podcasting on animal health?  How could one measure the quantity and quality of the impact of the veterinarian information shared with inhabitants of isolated farms in the targeted areas of Zimbabwe?  How could the delivery of veterinary information via podcasts be compared with the delivery of veterinary information via other means of communion?  The Capability Approach provides a useful framework for assessing appropriate technology projects. 
 These projects are assessed in terms of their impact on important capabilities and their key indicators.  Specifically one asks whether a project has expanded or contracted the capabilities designated as important to well-being by the community members themselves.</item> 

<item>The analysis presented by Oosterlaken et al. also provides several insights into this case that are not forthcoming when one concentrates primarily on appropriate technology’s “specific criteria” like those discussed above in this module.  Authors were able to discuss efforts by the government to restrict the technologies used in the podcasts to those that facilitated control of content; government officials wanted to make sure that the podcasts were not converted into occasions for criticizing government policies.  Moreover, authors dealt with how the podcasting events reinforced questionable local attitudes toward gender roles; the subordinate position of women in these communities was reinforced by having the women sit in the back of the broadcast audiences where they had trouble hearing the materials presented.  Finally, local residents used podcasting technologies to access entertainment content rather than restricting the broadcasts to market and veterinary information.</item>  

<item>The Capability Approach provides a convenient way of posing situation where one capability comes into conflict with other capabilities.  In this case the capability of play tends to crowd out other capabilities such as control over (economic) environment.  In short, this case provides you with the opportunity to explore the Capability Approach in terms of (1) how it gives specific content to well-being and (2) how well-being is expanded as it is integrated with autonomy (agency) and justice (Oosterlaken).  Finally, the Capability Approach provides a useful “correct theory” to support compassion by fleshing out the notion of well-being.  Compassion no longer implies taking a condescending attitude toward those who are the subjects of this emotion.  Targeting capabilities means that one seeks to empower those who are suffering from sizable misfortune; it seeks to empower those who suffer.</item></list><para id="eip-780">
